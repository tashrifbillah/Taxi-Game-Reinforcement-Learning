In this project, we shall implement some reinforcement learning techniques i.e Policy iteration, Q-learning and SARSA for the Taxi Game environment. For each implementation, we shall give optimal solutions and graphs. We shall also plot the learning progress of both algorithms for training 1000 episodes. Please see the [project report](https://github.com/tashrifbillah/Taxi-Game-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/Taxi%20Game%20Project.pdf) for detailed description.
